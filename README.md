Simulating base retrieval

## Why ?

Help develop a protocol that solves the "Lifeline" problem where a search team needs to communicate with their base in a hazardous environment.

⚠️ This tool isn't a general-purpose simulator for swarms of autonomous mobiles robots. It focuses only on the "Lifeline" problem.
